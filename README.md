# Demo game for 3D game engine

https://wiki.mozilla.org/Paladin/Workflow has our basic workflow.  

https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/337777 is where we're tracking user 
stories.

We've decided to use the [gitflow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), and we've made the "develop" branch be the default branch for the rescuefox repo.  The "master" branch is only for tagged, production releases.

We expect to have live instances of both the develop and master branches
for playing up before too long.
